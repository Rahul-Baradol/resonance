# Resonance

This started with thought of <br>
`What if i lose all the songs that i have saved till now? For whatever reason ðŸ˜†!`

So how about saving them, somewhere safe, so that even if spotify goes down, some night, I would be having the songs saved with their names and artists 
<br><br>
And here it is, built this is in around 2 days, where 
- backend is a Spring Boot application 
- frontend is a simple NextJS app (credit to [bolt.new](https://bolt.new/))

### The idea is simple.

I authorize the Spring Boot with spotify (once), and it will keep hitting spotify APIs every x minute, to get my latest playlists, and save them to the db
<br><br>
Currently am using MongoDB, we can extend this to store in multiple dbs as well. 

Have tried to keep the system as extensible as possible, so that we can integrate other streaming services as well  

## Deployment

- NextJS is deployed on frontend
- Spring is deployed on render 
- MongoDB is deployed on free Atlas cluster
